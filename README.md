# DGEFi Protocols
A decentralized financial protocol built specially for the global distributed Green Energy Community
  
## Brief to DGEFI Protocols 

DGEFI is an innovative decentralized financial protocol and an innovative attempt in programmable currency and community governance. It is constructed by a set of DeFi intelligent protocols, thus constructing deposit and loan businesses similar to banks (that is, GBank's main business). All intelligent protocols of decentralized finance are voted, deployed, and re-executed through the GBank community. The security of the protocol code is audited by a third party. To create:

> DGE is the flexible supply mechanism of tokens to seek the steady growth of the ultimate intrinsic value of digital tokens;

> Community-managed decentralized and trusted digital commercial banks;

> Linked to global green energy entity assets, thus realizing global green energy autonomous communities.

> DGE is a standard-token of DGEFi protocol, with a total of 1 million shares issued for the first time, that is, 1 million DGEs issued initially. 

> The core of DGEFi protocol is a flexible supply encryption digital currency mechanism, which will inflate and reduce its supply according to market conditions. Its goal is to increase or decrease the underlying digital assets, the intrinsic value represented by each DGE will not depreciate excessively due to inflation.

> The adoption of this flexible supply mechanism is a supplement to existing flexible supply models (such as Ampleforth), A part of each inflation expansion is used to purchase a set of digital assets (such as yDAI ,cDAI,yUSD, etc.) with higher returns and lower risks, and add it to the bottom liquidity Library <treasuryFactory> of DGE, which is managed by DGE community.

> We built DGE as the lowest feasible experimental financial digital currency. After deployment, its intrinsic value completely depends on the value of DGE's underlying assets to determine its market price and future governance direction. We will also use the branch of the composite governance module <Snapshot> to ensure that all updates to the DGEFI protocol are completed through community voting and are completely executed on the chain.

## DGEFi Target
It aims to become the first community autonomous green digital encryption Bank based on blockchain technology, providing support for the entity assets of global distributed green energy autonomous communities.
